# ks2autouploader
simple script to upload replays automatically to lucy's server!  
you need node.js and npm installed to run this script.  
also make a `ignore.json` and `config.json` in the same directory as the script.
in `ignore.json` put `[]` and in `config.json` just copy `config.example.json` and change it for your relevant data (id is your sc2 id and path is where your replays are saved)  
enjoy!
